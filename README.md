# Snake
A first attempt at coding the simple game 'snake' using Java in android studio.

I have managed to successfully code the snake and 'Bob' object with the relevant graphics which display on the screen.

BUT when I run the game, it starts automatically and the snake object is everywhere. I think there is an error in the update() or onCreate(). Although I'm not exactly sure!
